    id: 'invite-teammate',
    category: 'Account & Billing',
    question: 'How do I invite a teammate to my organization?',
    answer:
      'Open Settings › Profile and share your workspace, or send your referral link from Settings › Referrals. Teammates you invite join under the same account so they can view the plots and alerts you grant them. Full multi-seat role management is rolling out alongside specialist and producer accounts.',
  },
  {
    id: 'billing-cycle',
    category: 'Account & Billing',
    question: 'Can I change my billing cycle from monthly to annual?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Go to Subscription, open Available plans and choose the annual tier, then Switch plan. You are redirected to MercadoPago to confirm the payment; the new cycle applies from the next billing period and any change is prorated on your following invoice.',
  },
  {
    id: 'update-card',
    category: 'Account & Billing',
    question: 'How do I update the card on file?',
    answer:
      'Your card is stored securely by MercadoPago — Viora never keeps your full card number. The payment method shown in Subscription updates automatically to the card you use the next time you complete a payment through MercadoPago checkout.',
  },
  {
    id: 'device-offline',
    category: 'Plots & IoT devices',
    question: 'Why is my plot showing "IoT device offline"?',
    answer:
      'A device is marked offline when it has not reported a reading within its expected interval. Check the gateway power and connectivity, confirm the sensor is within range, and verify the device is still linked to the plot in IoT Devices. Readings resume automatically once the device reconnects.',
  },
  {
    id: 'iot-per-plot',
    category: 'Plots & IoT devices',
    question: 'How many IoT devices can I connect per plot?',
    answer:
      'The limit depends on your plan. Grower Plus supports up to 10 devices and Grower Pro up to 100 across your account. Your current usage is shown on the Subscription screen under "IoT devices connected".',
  },
  {
    id: 'register-plot',
    category: 'Plots & IoT devices',
    question: 'How do I register a new plot?',
    answer:
      'Go to My Plots › add a plot, draw or upload the field boundary on the map, and confirm. Viora computes the area automatically and begins pulling satellite NDVI and weather data for that boundary. You can then link IoT devices to the plot.',
  },
  {
    id: 'critical-alert',
    category: 'Alerts & Nutrition',
    question: 'What triggers a "Critical" alert?',
    answer:
      'Critical alerts combine severity signals: a sharp NDVI drop, sensor thresholds breached, and — for pests — a confirmed symptom report or a quarantine-relevant threat such as suspected Xylella. Critical alerts are surfaced first and are the ones best suited to escalate through Expert Assistance.',
  },
  {
    id: 'dynamic-nutrition',
    category: 'Alerts & Nutrition',
    question: 'How does Dynamic Nutrition calculate recommendations?',
    answer:
      "It combines your plot's phenological stage, recent NDVI and vigor trends, soil and climate signals, and crop requirements to suggest nutrition adjustments across the season. Recommendations are advisory — the final agronomic decision always remains with the grower or their specialist.",
  },
  {
    id: 'assistance-response',
    category: 'Expert Assistance',
    question: 'How quickly do specialists respond to Expert Assistance requests?',
    answer:
      "Response targets depend on your plan and are defined in the Service Level Agreement. Requests linked to Critical alerts are prioritized. You can track each request's status — pending, proposal received, or accepted — from the Expert Assistance screen.",
  },
  {
    id: 'same-specialist',
    category: 'Expert Assistance',
    question: 'Can I request the same specialist across multiple interventions?',
    answer:
      'Yes, when that specialist is available for the plot and alert in question. Specialists are ranked per request by availability, success rate and distance, but you can send a new request to a specialist you have worked with before from their profile card.',
  },
  {
    id: 'export-history',
    category: 'Data & Reports',
    question: 'Can I export my expense and intervention history?',
    answer:
      'Expense history and intervention records are available in their respective screens and can be reviewed per plot and per billing cycle. Structured export (CSV/PDF) of expenses, invoices and intervention outcomes is on the roadmap for reporting and accounting workflows.',
  },
  {
    id: 'data-retention',
    category: 'Data & Reports',
    question: 'How long is historical plot data retained?',
    answer:
      'Active accounts retain plot, sensor and agronomic history for the life of the account so you can review season-over-season trends. After account deactivation, data is retained for a limited period and then deleted or anonymized as described in the Privacy Policy.',
